Bitch, I'm a player, I'm too motherfuckin' stingy for Cher
Won't even lend you an ear ain't even pretendin' to care
But I tell a bitch I'll marry her, if she'll bury her
Face on my genital area, the original Richard Ramirez
Christian Rivera '
'Cause my lyrics never sit well so they wanna give me the chair
Like a paraplegic, and it's scary, call it Harry Carry
'Cause every Tom and Dick and Harry
Carry a Merriam motherfuckin' dictionary
Got 'em swearin' up and down, they can't spit, this shit's hilarious
It's time to put these bitches in the obituary column
We wouldn't see eye to eye with a staring problem
Get the shaft out like a steering column (Mark Jack)

Trigger happy, pack heat, but it's black ink
Evil half of the Bad Meets
Evil, that means take a back seat
Take it back to Fat Petes with a maxi, single
Look at my rap sheets, what attracts these people
Is my gangster, bitch, like Apache with a catchy jingle
I stack these chips, you barely got a half-eaten Cheeto

Fill 'em with the venom, and eliminate 'em
Other words, I Minute Maid 'em
I don't want to hurt 'em, but I did 'em in a fit of rage
I'm murderin' again, nobody will evade him
I'm finna kill 'em and dump all the fuckin' bodies in a lake
Obliteratin' everything, incineratin' and renegade 'em
And I make anybody who want it with the pen afraid
But don't nobody want it but they're gonna get it anyway

'Cause I'm beginnin' to feel like I'm mentally ill
I'm Atilla, kill or be killed, I'm a killer, be the vanilla gorilla
You're bringin' the killer within me, out of me
You don't want to be the enemy of the demon
Who went in me, and be on the recieving of me, what stupidity, it'd be
Every bit of me is the epitome of a spitter
When I'm in the vicinity, motherfucker, you better duck
Or you finna be dead the minute you run into me
A hundred percent of you is a fifth of a percent of me
I'm 'bout to fuckin' finish you bitch, I'm unfadable
You wanna battle, I'm available, I'm blowin' up like an inflatable
I'm undebatable, I'm unavoidable, I'm unevadable

Unbelievable, yes, yes, inconceivable
See myself as fairly reasonable
But at times I can be stubborn, so
If I have to, I will rock the boat
I don't tend to take the easy road
That's just not the way I like to roll
What you think's probably unfeasible
I've done already a hundredfold, a hundredfold

It's probable that I might press the envelope
Ideas so astronomical
Sometimes I find them comical
Yeah, incomparable
Replay value phenomenal
Beat selection remarkable
Slowing me down, impossible
