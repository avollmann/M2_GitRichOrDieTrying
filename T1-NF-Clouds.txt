Monster
You get in my way? I'ma feed you to the monster (Yeah)
I'm normal during the day, but at night turn to a monster (Yeah)
When the moon shines like Ice Road Truckers
I look like a villain outta those blockbusters

Godzilla, fire spitter, monster
Blood on the dance floor, and on the Louis V carpet
Fire, Godzilla, fire, monster
Blood on the dance floor, and on the Louis V carpet

I stay committed, embrace the rigid
I'm playful with it, yeah, basically
Too great to mimic, you hate, you're bitter
No favoritism, that's fine with me
Create the riddles, portrayed uncivil
Unsafe a little, oh yes, indeed
It's plain and simple, I'm far from brittle
Unbreakable, you following?

I'm Bruce Willis in a train wreck
I'm like trading in your car for a new jet
I'm like having a boss getting upset
'Cause you asked him for less on your paycheck
I'm like doing headstands with a broke neck
I'm like watching your kid take his first steps
I'm like sayin' Bill Gates couldn't pay rent
'Cause he's too broke- where am I goin' with this?

Unbelievable, yes, yes, inconceivable
See myself as fairly reasonable
But at times I can be stubborn, so
If I have to, I will rock the boat
I don't tend to take the easy road
That's just not the way I like to roll
What you think's probably unfeasible
I've done already a hundredfold, a hundredfold

It's probable that I might press the envelope
Ideas so astronomical
Sometimes I find them comical
Yeah, incomparable
Replay value phenomenal
Beat selection remarkable
Slowing me down, impossible
