Monster
You get in my way? I'ma feed you to the monster (Yeah)
I'm normal during the day, but at night turn to a monster (Yeah)
When the moon shines like Ice Road Truckers
I look like a villain outta those blockbusters

Godzilla, fire spitter, monster
Blood on the dance floor, and on the Louis V carpet
Fire, Godzilla, fire, monster
Blood on the dance floor, and on the Louis V carpet

I stay committed, embrace the rigid
I'm playful with it, yeah, basically
Too great to mimic, you hate, you're bitter
No favoritism, that's fine with me
Create the riddles, portrayed uncivil
Unsafe a little, oh yes, indeed
It's plain and simple, I'm far from brittle
Unbreakable, you following?

I'm Bruce Willis in a train wreck
I'm like trading in your car for a new jet
I'm like having a boss getting upset
'Cause you asked him for less on your paycheck
I'm like doing headstands with a broke neck
I'm like watching your kid take his first steps
I'm like sayin' Bill Gates couldn't pay rent
'Cause he's too broke- where am I goin' with this?

If you never gave a damn, raise your hand
'Cause I'm about to set trip, vacation plans
I'm on point, like my index is, so all you will ever get is
The motherfuckin' finger (Finger), prostate exam ('xam)
How can I have all these fans and perspire?
Like a liar's pants, I'm on fire
And I got no plans to retire and I'm still the man you admire
These chicks are spazzin' out, I only get more handsome and flier
I got 'em passin' out like what you do, when you hand someone flyers

What goes around comes around just like the blades on a chainsaw
'Cause I caught the flaps of my dollar stack
Right off the bat like a baseball, like Kid Ink
Bitch, I got them racks with so much ease that they call me Diddy
'Cause I make bands and I call getting cheese a cakewalk (Cheesecake)
